# Chosen APIs

1. **APOD API**: This API displays the astronomy picture or video of the day and provides a brief description about the provided picture or video.

2. **Mars Rover Photo API**: This API provides images gathered by NASA rovers named Curiosity, Spirit, and Opportunity. It allows users to input rover name, Martian days (SOL), camera name of the selected rover, mission manifest, and the Earth date the picture was taken.

3. **Mars Rover Manifast API**: This api is used to check mars rover details.

## Difficulties Faced

1. **Making the Site Responsive with React Video Player**:
   - **Problem**: Difficulty in making the site responsive when using the React video player.
   - **Solution**: Implemented separate methods for making the video player responsive and for smaller devices.

2. **Handling Picture Links for Spirit and Opportunity Rovers**:
   - **Problem**: When selecting the Spirit or Opportunity rover and viewing the Mars rover pictures, the API provides a link to the picture which redirects to a NASA website instead of loading the picture, causing an error.
   - **Solution**: Display "No Content Available" when pictures are not found.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
